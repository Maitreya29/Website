        <hr>
        <span>
            <p>It all started on a sunny morning when Rudra Sharma drafted <b>Technolympics</b> which was not a copy of <b>(c)ync</b> and was very happy about it. He caught his breath and planned out the whole event secretly like a ninja, but to his utter dissapointment, everybody got to know about the great event. Fir kya tha... better names for the event like <b>Spectre</b> and <b>Hive</b> started getting brainstormed but with due decisions of our alumnis as well as the members, we settled on the name <b>Technocon</b>. Oh shiz, I almost forgot this is not Technocon. Basically the story for Rudra's Insitute is very short.. After we had great leadership and guidance, we decided to form an instiute for the <i>legends</i>, period.</p>

        <h2 style="background: red; color: white; padding: 3px; text-align: center;">Principles and committments.</h2>
        <span>
            <p>At Rudra Institute, we follow principles and committments that make us a great human being and future <b>Computer Club Directors</b>. For the benefit of our students, alumnis, associated parteners and stakeholders(parents), We have created an <b>Almanac</b> that lists everything you need to know to become a CCD.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Never call somebody names, it hurts.</li>
                <li>Plan everything before, and don't end up in a mess of Hive.</li>
                <li>You can try and give somebody a <b>Headphone Wedgie</b> to get attention.</li>
                <li>Blah blah blah - ye sab mai se kuch mat kriyo</li>
            </ul>
